# Hamad Airport Terminal Traversal

**Doha Airport Terminal Traversal**: 
An airport geek wants to explore the entire airport of Doha. Currently, the airport
has 41 gates with airline lounges. Given the airport map which is listed as an undirected graph, lets make a Depth-First
Search Traversal of the airport to visit every gate or lounge. For example you are allowed
to visit the terminal **after** you clear security (Node **S**).
> **Formal Description**:
>  * Input: An undirected graph of the airport terminal consisting of gates and lounges
>  * Output: A list of all the gates and the lounges visited within the terminal!

**Graph Problem/Algorithm**: [DFS]

**Solution code:**

```python
def airportDFS():
    VisitedAirportArea = {node: False for node in G.nodes}
    ListOfGates = [StartLocation]
    GatesTraversed = []
    while ListOfGates:
        current_gates = ListOfGates.pop()
        if not VisitedAirportArea[current_gates]:
            GatesTraversed.append(current_gates)

                ListOfGates.append(node)
    print("The gates that you traversed is: ", "->".join(GatesTraversed))
```

**Output**

```
 S->T->C2->C4->C6->C8->C10->C12->D2->E2->E4->E3->E1->C11->C9->C7->C5->C3->C1->AM->B1->B4->B6->B8->B10->B9->B7->B5->B3->B2->ASL->A1->A4->A6->A9->A11->A10->A8->A7->A5->A3->A2->D4->D3->D1->ALS
```

**Interpretation of Results**:
Based on our results, the airport geek starts
from security and visits the terminal. We then visit Concourse C and visit the even gates
C2, C4, C6, C8, C10. Once we get to concourse D, We visit D2 and then move on to node E2 and visit 
the remaining gates in Concourse E. Then we visit the odd gates in Concourse C,
visit the Al-Mourjain Lounge (node AM) and visit all Concourse B,
The First Class Al-Saffaya Lounge (node ASL), all concourse A, visits the remaining
gates D1, D3 and D4 and ends in style in the Al-Saffya First class lounge

 **Shortest Netowrk Path for Transporting Packets**: 
A network security team would like to know the shortest path to transport packets from a starting router
to a target router.  The team is presented with a network of 25 routers with arbitrary speeds between them.
The routers are represented by a undirected weighted graph with the routers as nodes and the speeds as edges.
In order to assess the fastest path from starting router to target router, the team will use Dijkstra's algorithm.
The team will use the following code to determine the fastest path from the starting router to the target router.
> **Formal Description**:
>  * Input: A weighted undirected graph with the routers as nodes and the speeds as edges.
>  * Output: The fastest path from the starting router to the target router.

**Code**:

```python
import networkx as nx
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import random

G = nx.Graph()

# City Traversal by Taxi Service
A taxi driver wants to provide a service bringing passengers to a very popular airport in the city. He needs to know the shortest path to get to the airport from any address in the city. We will represent the addresses in the city as the nodes of a graph, and the streets will be edges.
> **Formal Description**:
>  * Input: An unweighted, undirected graph where the nodes are addresses in the city.
>  * Output: A guide for the driver to get to a specific node (the airport) from any other node.

**Output**

Example for if the driver is at node 9 and the airport is at node 22:

> Start is 22. End is 9. Path is 9 -> 10 -> 1 -> 2 -> 22

![Visualization of BFS graph after the algorithm.](after-bfs.png)

**Interpretation of Results**

Above shows a tree of the paths to the airport (node 22). The numbers on the top line are the labels for each address. The numbers on the bottom are the next address to visit to get to the airport (left) and the distance from the airport (right).

Using this tree, the driver can get to the airport from anywhere in the city. All he needs to do is follow the tree back to the airport's node. For example, if the driver is at node 9, his path would be 9 -> 10 -> 1 -> 2 -> 22.
